Web development is an exciting journey that combines creativity with technical skills. In this post, we'll explore the fundamentals of web development and how to get started on your own journey.

## The Three Pillars of Web Development

Web development is built on three main technologies:

*   HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
*   CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
*   JavaScript

## Getting Started

Here's a simple example of how these technologies work together:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            margin: 40px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <script>
        console.log("Welcome to web development!");
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics, you can explore:

*   Frontend frameworks like React or Vue.js
*   Backend development with Node.js or Python
*   Database management
*   Web security best practices
